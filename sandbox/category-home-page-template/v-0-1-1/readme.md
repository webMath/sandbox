Welcome to the Exploratoria home page!

Exploratoria is a GitHub Organization. Feel free to request an invitation to join. 


## Concept

### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->
* To devise free, open source scripts that help visualize and further understanding of scientific and mathematical concepts
* To supply scripts that help engineers and designers to create experiments without having to be dedicated software programmers
* To help youngsters and oldsters delve into new topics with a hands-on, active, 'I can play with this' approach
* To create apps that work not just on computers but also on mobile devices such as phones and tablets

### Vision  
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To help envision new types of visualizations
* To help people understand, tackle and push the envelope with increasingly complicated tasks


## Exhibits

The intention is to provide scripts dealing with the following categories:

* Aerospace
* Astronomy & Solar System
* Biology
* Chemistry
* Color
* Electricity & Magnetism
* Energy
* Engineering & Structure
* Geology
* Heat & Temperature *
* Human Anatomy
* Language & Speech
* Light
* Materials
* Mathematics & Patterns
* Mechanics, Dynamics & Motion
* Navigation & Mapping
* Smell - Taste - Touch
* Sound & Hearing
* Vision & Eye Logic
* Water
* Waves & Resonance
* Weather

&#42; indicates categories with exhibits 

Noticeably absent are categories pertaining to computers, the Internet, digital media and the like. 
This website uses technology to explain, show and demonstrate the physical and theoretical aspects of our world. 
It attempts to achieve the best of what technology should do in the real world.

## Cookbook

Short coding samples - also called snippets - solutions to common tasks, 'presented in detail so that the users who are not necessarily expert in the field can produce workable results'.
