Experiments in displaying three columns

* Column 1 (side) displays a list of scripts
* Column 2 (edit) displays editable code
* Column 3 (view) displays the running script


The purpose of these schematics is not related to the display of content or appearance, but is related to the behavior of the columns and the intuitiveness of the interafce

* Can you readily identify the purpose of the three columns
* If a column is invisible, can you make it visible again
* Does the operation flow smoothly? Can you find the exact file that you are looking for quickly? Can you peruse a number of files effortlessly?

Looks OK when hamburger is all the way to the left.

If the script opened with hamburger on left:

* Would you know to click on it in order to see the list of scripts
* Would it be consing to see the text on top of text?

content (HTML) and appearance( CSS, fonts and sizes etc) are not yet paramount
