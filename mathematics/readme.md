## Concept

### Mission

* This is an effort to make the visualization of things mathematical faster, simpler and easier
* The code should be as simple and as extensible as possible
* If you understand if/then, for loops and equal signs in JavaScript you should be good to go
* The code should have the look and feel of Three.js code.
* If you are familiar with the Three.js examples, you should be able to jump right into algeSurf code


### Vision

* Visualize math and physics in ways never seen before
* Enable people who are scientists, engineers and designers and not full-time programmers to craft cool domain-specific apps

### Status 2015-08-31

* Three.js links need updating to appropriate CDN links
* All need testing on Safari/iOS
